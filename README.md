# Feature-Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself.
Discover the most effective way to improve your models.you will learn a practical approach to feature engineering.


Use of Feature Engineering:
---------------------------
* Develop a baseline model for comparing performance on models with more features
* Encode categorical features so the model can make better use of the information
* Generate new features to provide more information for the model
* Select features to reduce overfitting and increase prediction speed
